## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

After deployment, verify all pages are accessible:

### Test 1: Page Accessibility

Open in incognito/private browser (to avoid cache):

1. **SMS Terms**: https://betaranch.com/sms-terms.html
   - Should show: "YardHawk SMS Terms of Service" heading
   - Should have: PullTag and ReturnPing sections
   - Should include: Opt-out instructions

2. **Privacy Policy**: https://betaranch.com/privacy.html
   - Should show: "Privacy Policy" heading
   - Should have: SMS Communications section
   - Should include: Data retention information

3. **SMS Opt-In**: https://betaranch.com/sms-opt-in.html
   - Should show: "Sign Up for YardHawk SMS Notifications" heading
   - Should have: How to Sign Up section with workflows
   - Should include: Example messages

### Test 2: Content Verification

For each page, verify:

- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] All text is readable (no weird formatting)
- [ ] Links work correctly (especially internal links)
- [ ] No placeholder text remains (like "[TO BE FILLED]")
- [ ] Mobile responsive (test on phone or resize browser)
- [ ] No login required to view

### Test 3: External Link Test

Run these pages through a link checker:
- https://www.deadlinkchecker.com/
- Or use Chrome extension: "Check My Links"

All internal links should work:
- `/sms-terms.html` ‚Üí `/privacy.html` ‚úÖ
- `/privacy.html` ‚Üí `/sms-terms.html` ‚úÖ
- `/sms-opt-in.html` ‚Üí both other pages ‚úÖ

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Pages Show 404 Error

**Cause**: Files not in root directory or GitHub Pages not enabled

**Fix**:
1. Ensure files are in repository root (not in subdirectory)
2. Check GitHub Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí ensure Pages is enabled
3. Verify source branch is correct (usually `main` or `gh-pages`)

---

### Issue: Pages Show Old Content

**Cause**: Browser cache or GitHub Pages cache

**Fix**:
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild
4. Check in incognito/private mode

---

### Issue: Internal Links Don't Work

**Cause**: Wrong path or missing leading slash

**Fix**:
- Links should be: `/sms-terms.html` (with leading slash)
- Not: `sms-terms.html` (without slash)
- All current HTML files use correct format

---

### Issue: Styling Looks Broken

**Cause**: CSS embedded in HTML may not load properly

**Fix**:
1. View page source (Ctrl+U or Cmd+U)
2. Verify `<style>` tags are present in `<head>`
3. Check for any error messages in browser console (F12)

If styles are missing, the HTML files may have been corrupted during copy.
Re-copy original files from `docs/twilio-verification/static-pages/`

## üì∏ Screenshot Documentation (Optional but Recommended)

For Twilio submission, having screenshots can help:

### Take Screenshots Of:

1. **SMS Opt-In Page** (most important)
   - Full page screenshot showing complete workflow
   - Highlight the "How to Sign Up" section

2. **SMS Terms Page**
   - Screenshot showing PullTag and ReturnPing sections
   - Shows message examples

3. **Privacy Policy**
   - Screenshot showing "SMS Communications" section

### Screenshot Tools:

- **Windows**: Windows + Shift + S (Snipping Tool)
- **Mac**: Cmd + Shift + 4 (screenshot portion)
- **Browser Extensions**:
  - "Full Page Screen Capture" (Chrome)
  - "Awesome Screenshot" (Firefox/Chrome)

### Where to Host Screenshots:

- **GitHub**: Create `/images/` folder in repo
- **Imgur**: Upload to https://imgur.com (free, publicly accessible)
- **Google Drive**: Upload and set sharing to "Anyone with link"

Then provide screenshot URLs in Twilio verification form.
