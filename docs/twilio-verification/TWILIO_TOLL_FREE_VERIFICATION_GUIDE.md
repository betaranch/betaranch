### Step 2: Use Case Description

Twilio requires a clear explanation of how you'll use the toll-free number.

#### Primary Use Case: **Equipment Rental Operations Management**

**Detailed Description to Submit:**

```
YardHawk is a B2B software platform for construction equipment rental companies.
We send transactional SMS notifications to rental yard staff and rental customers
for operational purposes:

1. PullTag: Equipment gathering notifications sent to yard staff when customer
   orders require equipment to be pulled from the rental yard. Messages include
   pull tag ID, customer name, and link to equipment details.

2. ReturnPing: Rental return reminders sent to rental customers 24 hours before
   equipment is due back, helping ensure timely returns and reduce late fees.

All messages are transactional and operational in nature. We do NOT send marketing
or promotional messages. Message frequency: Yard staff receive 5-20 messages per
day during peak operations; customers receive 1-2 messages per rental contract.

Recipients are either employees of rental companies using our software or customers
renting equipment from those companies. All recipients provide explicit consent
through onboarding or rental contract signup.
```

**Character Count**: ~800 characters (well within Twilio limits)

---

### Step 3: Opt-In Process Documentation

Twilio requires proof that users consent to receive messages.

#### Opt-In Method: **WEB_FORM** (Primary) + **VERBAL** (Secondary)

**Primary Opt-In Workflow Description:**

```
YardHawk has two distinct opt-in workflows:

YARD STAFF OPT-IN:
1. Organization administrator adds employee to YardHawk system via web console
2. Administrator enters employee's mobile number in the roster management form
3. Web form includes checkbox: "I confirm this employee consents to receive
   operational SMS notifications from YardHawk for equipment pull requests"
4. Employee receives welcome SMS: "Welcome to YardHawk! You'll receive equipment
   pull notifications. Reply STOP to opt out. Reply HELP for support."
5. Employee can opt out anytime by replying STOP

RENTAL CUSTOMER OPT-IN:
1. During equipment rental contract setup, rental company asks customer:
   "Would you like to receive SMS reminders before your equipment is due back?"
2. Customer verbally agrees and provides mobile number
3. Rental staff enters number in YardHawk contract form with opt-in confirmation
4. Customer receives: "ABC Rentals will send you return reminders via YardHawk.
   Reply STOP to opt out."

Both workflows use branded YardHawk messaging, are specific to described use cases,
and allow immediate opt-out via STOP command.
```

#### Opt-In Page URL to Submit:

**URL**: `https://betaranch.com/sms-opt-in.html`

This page clearly shows:
- How users sign up (onboarding for staff, rental contract for customers)
- Example messages they'll receive
- Opt-out instructions (reply STOP)
- Message frequency expectations
- Privacy information

**Screenshot Recommendation**: Take a screenshot of the opt-in page showing the complete workflow and submit as supporting documentation.

## üéØ Best Practices for Approval

Based on Twilio's verification best practices:

### ‚úÖ Do This:

1. **Match Everything**: Ensure business name on website matches legal name in Twilio
2. **Use Business Email**: Use @betaranch.com email, not personal Gmail/Yahoo
3. **Be Specific**: Provide detailed use case description (we did above)
4. **Show Branding**: All opt-in pages and messages mention "YardHawk"
5. **Separate Consent**: Opt-in is standalone, not buried in general terms
6. **Real Content**: Website has substantive content about YardHawk services

### ‚ùå Avoid This:

1. **Vague Descriptions**: Don't just say "operational messages" - be specific
2. **Shared Consent**: Don't share opt-in across multiple use cases
3. **Login Walls**: All verification URLs must be publicly accessible (no login required)
4. **Generic Emails**: Don't use gmail.com or other personal email domains
5. **Missing Pages**: Ensure all URLs resolve and show proper content
